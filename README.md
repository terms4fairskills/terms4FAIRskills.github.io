# terms4FAIRskills

Building a terminology for the skills necessary to make data FAIR and to keep it FAIR.

The terms4FAIRskills project aims to create a formalised terminology that describes the competencies, skills and knowledge associated with making and keeping data FAIR. When mature, this terminology will apply to a variety of use cases, including:
- To assist with the creation and assessment of stewardship curricula;
- To facilitate the annotation, discovery and evaluation of FAIR-enabling materials (e.g. training) and resources;
- To enable the formalisation of job descriptions and CVs with recognised, structured competencies.

The completed terminology will be of use to trainers who teach FAIR data skills, researchers who wish to identify skill gaps in their teams and managers who need to recruit individuals to relevant roles.

### Current Status - the EOSC co-creation award July 2020  
  
![EOSC](img/EOSCsecretariat.png "EOSC")  

In July 2020, we received notification of our successful application for EOSC co-creation funding to continue this work.  

Thanks to our successful EOSC co-creation proposal, we will continue to develop the FAIR Skills Terminology (FST) with our annotation and coordination groups to create v0.1 of the terminology. We will use a number of real-world use cases to drive this development to ensure a broad and pragmatic initial spread of terms. These terms will be refined via iterative annotation of training materials. Annotation will be performed using the Semaphora tool and will continue until an initial prototype terminology is created.  

Here is a snapshot of our current working model.

**We hope to present a prototype of this terminology in the 1st quarter of 2021.**

In the meantime, progress can be followed here and on our related [terminology repository](https://github.com/terms4fairskills/FAIRterminology).

### How We Started and Outreach

terms4FAIRskills sprung out of a community need identified at the GO FAIR Coordination meeting in the January of 2019. Since then, we have hosted two workshops:  

[The first f2f meeting (Paris, FR May 2019)](https://terms4fairskills.github.io/Announcement.html)  

[The second f2f meeting (The Hague, NL October 2019)](https://terms4fairskills.github.io/2ndWorkshopHagueAnnouncement.html)  

We have presented terms4FAIRskills at a number of conferences, including (but not limited to):
- EOSC Symposium November 2019 (Budapest, Hungary)
- FAIRification Mini Symposium (ELIXIR AHM - virtual) June 2020 (see a video of the [ten minute presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d21y9glx_fw&feature=youtu.be))
- EOSC Symposium October 2020 (virtual) ([slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mMjMO1mdl1UyL4_X43Tv4wqlJBZnf_YC/view?usp=sharing))
- CODATA/GO-FAIR Convergence December 2020 (virtual) (slides to come)
