# terms4FAIRskills

Building a terminology for the skills necessary to make data FAIR and to keep it FAIR.

The terms4FAIRskills project aims to create a formalised terminology that describes the competencies, skills and knowledge associated with making and keeping data FAIR. When mature, this terminology will apply to a variety of use cases, including:
- To assist with the creation and assessment of stewardship curricula;
- To facilitate the annotation, discovery and evaluation of FAIR-enabling materials (e.g. training) and resources;
- To enable the formalisation of job descriptions and CVs with recognised, structured competencies.
 
The completed terminology will be of use to trainers who teach FAIR data skills, researchers who wish to identify skill gaps in their teams and managers who need to recruit individuals to relevant roles.

### Organisational structure:  

**Coordination Group** - provides oversight, governance, strategy and ensures progress. Provides an editional function to ensure consistency in all terminology drafts that are made public.  
**Annotation groups** - contributors to the terms and definitions created across the terminology, usually working on a specific section of the terminology, as well as providing annotation and comments on all content.  
**Ontology Maintainers** - people with ontology-building experience who lead that part of the process.  
**Workshop organising committee(s)** - local workshop organisers (in collaboration with the coordination group)
