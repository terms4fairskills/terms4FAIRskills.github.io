# terms4FAIRskills

Building a terminology for the skills necessary to make data FAIR and to keep it FAIR.

The terms4FAIRskills project aims to create a formalised terminology that describes the competencies, skills and knowledge associated with making and keeping data FAIR. When mature, this terminology will apply to a variety of use cases, including:
- To assist with the creation and assessment of stewardship curricula;
- To facilitate the annotation, discovery and evaluation of FAIR-enabling materials (e.g. training) and resources;
- To enable the formalisation of job descriptions and CVs with recognised, structured competencies.

The completed terminology will be of use to trainers who teach FAIR data skills, researchers who wish to identify skill gaps in their teams and managers who need to recruit individuals to relevant roles.

### Progress to date

terms4FAIRskills sprung out of a community need identified at the GO FAIR Coordination meeting in the January of 2019. Since then, we have hosted two workshops:

[The first f2f meeting (Paris, FR May 2019)](https://terms4fairskills.github.io/Announcement.html)

[The second f2f meeting (The Hague, NL October 2019)](https://terms4fairskills.github.io/2ndWorkshopHagueAnnouncement.html)

We have also presented terms4FAIRskills at a number of conferences, including the EOSC Symposium (Budapest, HU, November 2020), and in a FAIRification Mini Symposium at the ELIXIR AHM (virtual, June 2020) (see a video of the [ten minute presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d21y9glx_fw&feature=youtu.be))

In July 2020, we received notification of our successful application for EOSC co-creation funding to continue this work.

We will continue to develop the FAIR Skills Terminology (FST) with the annotation and coordination groups to create v0.1 of the terminology. We will use three real-world use cases to drive this development to ensure a broad and pragmatic initial spread of terms. These terms will be refined via iterative annotation of training materials. Annotation will be performed using the Semaphora tool and will continue until an initial prototype terminology is created.

We hope to present this terminology by the end of 2020.

In the meantime, progress can be followed here and on our related [terminology repository](https://github.com/terms4fairskills/FAIRterminology)
