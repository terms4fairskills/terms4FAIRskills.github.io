# terms4FAIRskills

Building a terminology for the skills necessary to make data FAIR and to keep it FAIR.

The terms4FAIRskills project has created a formalised terminology that describes the competencies, skills and knowledge associated with making and keeping data FAIR. This terminology can be used in a variety of use cases, including:
- To assist with the creation and assessment of stewardship curricula;
- To facilitate the annotation, discovery and evaluation of FAIR-enabling materials (e.g. training) and resources;
- To enable the formalisation of job descriptions and CVs with recognised, structured competencies.

terms4FAIRskills is of use to trainers who teach FAIR data skills, researchers who wish to identify skill gaps in their teams and managers who need to recruit individuals to relevant roles.  

The GitHub repository for the terminology is available at [https://github.com/terms4fairskills/FAIRterminology/](https://github.com/terms4fairskills/FAIRterminology/)

### OBO Foundry

We are a member of the the [OBO Foundry](https://obofoundry.org/), which builds and supports community-developed ontologies according to the [OBO Principles](https://obofoundry.org/principles/fp-000-summary.html). You can find our Foundry record at [https://obofoundry.org/ontology/t4fs.html](https://obofoundry.org/ontology/t4fs.html)

### Development

We continue to develop terms4FAIRskills and our latest terminology will always be found in our related [GitHub repository](https://github.com/terms4fairskills/FAIRterminology). New term requests and queries can be posted on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/terms4fairskills/FAIRterminology/issues/).

Currently, T4FS is based on the following model:

### History

#### How We Started

terms4FAIRskills sprung out of a community need identified at the GO FAIR Coordination meeting in the January of 2019. Since then, we have hosted two workshops:  

[The first f2f meeting (Paris, FR May 2019)](https://terms4fairskills.github.io/Announcement.html)

[The second f2f meeting (The Hague, NL October 2019)](https://terms4fairskills.github.io/2ndWorkshopHagueAnnouncement.html)

#### EOSC Co-creation Award July 2020 - February 2021
<br>
Thanks to our successful EOSC co-creation proposal, we continued to develop the Terms4FAIRskills (T4FS) using two real-life use cases - the CODATA/RDA Summer Schools and the ELIXIR Training Platform Training and Events Portal (TeSS). Through a number of workshops and hackathons, we iteratively annotated a large number of training materials using the Semaphora annotation tool.
  
Our report on this work can be found on Zenodo at the following DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.4705219](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4705219) and more information on our work during the award can be found on these two blogs:   
[EOSC Co-creation hackathons (virtual, December 2020)](https://codata.org/blog/2020/12/16/terms4fairskills-hackathons-december-2020/)   
[EOSC Co-creation hackathons (virtual, January 2021)](https://codata.org/blog/2021/02/)  

The annotations made via the Semaphora tool during the hackathons can be found [here](http://t4fs.esciencedatafactory.com)
