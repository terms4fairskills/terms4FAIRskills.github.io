# terms4FAIRskills

Building a terminology for the skills necessary to make data FAIR and to keep it FAIR.

The terms4FAIRskills project aims to create a formalised terminology that describes the competencies, skills and knowledge associated with making and keeping data FAIR. When mature, this terminology will apply to a variety of use cases, including:
- To assist with the creation and assessment of stewardship curricula;
- To facilitate the annotation, discovery and evaluation of FAIR-enabling materials (e.g. training) and resources;
- To enable the formalisation of job descriptions and CVs with recognised, structured competencies.

The completed terminology will be of use to trainers who teach FAIR data skills, researchers who wish to identify skill gaps in their teams and managers who need to recruit individuals to relevant roles.

Thanks to our successful EOSC co-creation proposal, we continued to develop the Terms4FAIRskills (T4FS) using two real-life use cases - the CODATA/RDA Summer Schools and the ELIXIR Training Platform Training and Events Portal (TeSS). Through a number of workshops and hackathons, we iteratively annotated a large number of training materials using the Semaphora annotation tool.

This has led to a new release of T4FS, which is available [here](https://github.com/terms4fairskills/FAIRterminology).

Currently, T4FS is based on the following model.

Our report on this work can be found on Zenodo at the following DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.4705219](https://https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4705219).

We continue to develop terms4FAIRskills and our latest terminology will always be found in our related [GitHub repository](https://github.com/terms4fairskills/FAIRterminology). New term requests and queries can be posted on our issue tracker.

### How We Started and Outreach

terms4FAIRskills sprung out of a community need identified at the GO FAIR Coordination meeting in the January of 2019. Since then, we have hosted two workshops:  

[The first f2f meeting (Paris, FR May 2019)](https://terms4fairskills.github.io/Announcement.html)  

[The second f2f meeting (The Hague, NL October 2019)](https://terms4fairskills.github.io/2ndWorkshopHagueAnnouncement.html)  

We have presented terms4FAIRskills at a number of conferences, including (but not limited to):
- EOSC Symposium November 2019 (Budapest, Hungary)
- FAIRification Mini Symposium (ELIXIR AHM - virtual) June 2020 (see a video of the [ten minute presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d21y9glx_fw&feature=youtu.be))
- EOSC Symposium October 2020 (virtual) ([slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mMjMO1mdl1UyL4_X43Tv4wqlJBZnf_YC/view?usp=sharing))
- CODATA/GO-FAIR Convergence December 2020 (virtual) (slides to come)
